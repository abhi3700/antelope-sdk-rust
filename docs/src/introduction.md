# Introduction

## Motivation

I am a Rust Maximalist. I love Rust. I love EOSIO. I love Rust and EOSIO. I have been involved with EOSIO 6 months prior to its launch. I was heavily involved into writing smart contracts in C++.

When I found there was no rust crate available for building EOSIO DApps e2e (end-to-end) in Rust. I decided to build one myself. I hope this crate can help Rust developers to build DApps on EOSIO blockchain.
