- move code from `src2/main.rs` to `get_info.rs` file & make it work.

- add mainnet, testnet (jungle, ...) as different networks available to connect to.
> Till then, just connect with `.env` file.

+ add status code check for different status codes, otherwise it doesn't log any errors in case of wrong status code.

+ add `examples/` folder to `Cargo.toml` as a workspace.
+ convert `src/main.rs` to a lib crate.
